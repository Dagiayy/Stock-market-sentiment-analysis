# **Sentiment Analysis and Stock Correlation Project**

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on analyzing financial news sentiment to explore its correlation with stock market movements. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, technical indicators, and statistical analysis, this project aims to uncover actionable insights for predicting stock price fluctuations based on news headlines. The project is part of the **10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery Program** and aligns with Nova Financial Solutions' mission to enhance predictive analytics capabilities.

The project involves:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Quantifying the tone of financial news headlines using NLP tools.
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculating metrics like Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) using TA-Lib and PyNance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Measuring the relationship between news sentiment scores and daily stock returns.

## **Example Usage or Output**

### **Sentiment Analysis**
The `sentiment_analysis.py` script analyzes the sentiment of news headlines. For example:
```python
from scripts.sentiment_analysis import analyze_sentiment

headline = "Stocks Surge as Earnings Beat Expectations"
sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(headline)
print(f"Sentiment Score: {sentiment_score}")
```
Output:
```
Sentiment Score: 0.85
```

### **Technical Indicators**
The `src/main.py` script calculates technical indicators like SMA, RSI, and MACD. Here’s an example visualization of Moving Averages:

### **Correlation Analysis**
The project computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between sentiment scores and stock returns. Example output:

```
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.45
```

### **Topic Modeling**
The `topic_modeling.py` script extracts key topics from headlines using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Example word cloud for Topic 1:
